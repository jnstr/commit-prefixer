# Commit prefixer

This is the convention I use to give extra context to my commits

## Why?

I really love the idea behind [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/), it allows you give extra context to your commit message with only one character, and it forces you to create small commits.

However, gitmoji has some drawbacks:
- It has way too many categories, which makes it hard to remember
- It is too colorful. I like my prefixes like my soul: black
- It felt a bit childish at times

That's why created my own set of git commit prefix icons. Just one character, and only a limited set.

## The list

### `[+]`: Adding a file or feature

_example: `[+] Add .gitignore`_

### `[B]` Fixing a bug

_example: `[B] Make it load in Internet Explorer`_

### `[-]`: Removing code or files

_example: `[-] Remove unused method`_

### `[M]`: Moving or renaming files

_example: `[M] Give it a more appropriate name`_

### `[L]`: Fixing linter errors & warnings

_example: `[L] Fix linting errors`_

### `[R]`: Refactoring existing code

_example: `[R] Split up into multiple methods`_

### `[T]`: Adding or updating tests

_example: `[T] Prove bug with a test`_

### `[!]`: Bad code that needs to be improved

_example: `[!] Hard-code these values for now`_

## Note

This list is mostly meant for personal reference, I do not intend to convince people to use this list.
